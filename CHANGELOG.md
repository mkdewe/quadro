# Changelog

All notable changes to quadro are recorded here. Versions follow the engine's
own naming (`14L`, `14M`, …) rather than semantic versioning, because that is
what the `.inp` files, the published results and the image tags refer to.

Each released version is archived on Zenodo and carries its own DOI.

## [14M]

The engine files are no longer versioned in their names: `engine/quadro.exe`
is the engine, whichever version `VERSION` says. That removes a class of stale
reference in scripts and documentation.

### Engine

- **The mirror pass is part of an ordinary run.** Previously a separate wrapper
  (`alternatywa14L.exe`) invoked behind `--alt`, it now runs automatically as a
  second pass: every invocation produces `<name>.pdb` and `<name>_alt.pdb`.
  A topology given by `orient`, `rise`, `twist` and `path` does not fix the
  handedness of the stack, and the ambiguity is only resolvable by building both
  and comparing `Etotal`, so it is not something to have to ask for.
  `--no-mirror` restores the single-pass behaviour.
- **Unrecognised keywords are rejected (`ERROR 26`)** instead of ignored. This
  is the fix for a real and hard-to-see failure: `shugar` in place of `sugar`
  was read as a comment, and the run completed normally having used the default
  pucker throughout. A result that is wrong in a way nothing reports is worse
  than one that fails.
- **A rejected input now exits non-zero.**
- Sequence alphabet widened: uppercase `T` (ribothymidine) and lowercase `u`
  (deoxyuridine) are accepted, with matching `RT` and `DU` entries in
  `other_residues.lib`. 14L rejected both with `ERROR 2`.
- `sugar` is the keyword. 14L's engine also called it `sugar`; the author's
  14M line spelled it `shugar`, and that spelling is gone.
- Engine comments and diagnostics are in English. `ERROR` messages were in
  Polish through 14L, which `docs/INPUT-FORMAT.md` had to carry a translation
  table for.
- The per-run base-pair and helix dump is printed under `test y` rather than
  unconditionally.
- `iteration` defaults to 300 rather than 50. The closing CYANA pass is fixed at
  100 steps; in 14L it ran for `iteration` steps and was preceded by a
  `read ang` of the accumulated angle file. Reference energies change
  accordingly — see `examples/reference/PROVENANCE.md`.
- `cyana2xplor14L.exe` is gone. Its thymine methyl-hydrogen fix is merged into
  `cyana2xplor.exe`, which is now the only converter.

### Examples

- `examples/7ys7.inp` replaces `examples/pz74.inp` as the example the
  documentation and the `tools/*.sh` banners point at. It exercises far more of
  the input format in one file — mixed tetrad polarity (`A-;B+;C-`), a negative
  `rise` next to a positive one, a negative `twist`, per-residue `chi` and
  `sugar`, and a `path` that does not fill its columns in sequence order — and
  it is the one example whose *unmirrored* reading wins, which the other two
  would otherwise make look like a rule.
- `pz74.inp` and `pz74-rm0.inp` are removed with it. Dot-bracket duplex syntax
  is still documented in `docs/INPUT-FORMAT.md` but no longer has a worked
  example.

### Removed

- **`iteration_steps`** was a local patch on 14L and is not part of 14M. Inputs
  carrying it are now rejected rather than silently ignored. To sample several
  build-up depths, run once per `iteration` value.
- The always-2 exit status, and the ~24 lines of commented-out source trailing
  the AWK program that caused it.

## [14L] — initial public release

- Standalone repository with the engine, its data libraries, a container recipe
  and documentation.
- CYANA and Xplor-NIH are supplied through BuildKit named build contexts rather
  than being part of the repository; neither may be redistributed. See
  `docs/THIRD-PARTY.md`.
- `docker/entrypoint.sh` gives a one-command interface
  (`docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" quadro14l:latest input.inp`) and stages
  inputs into the engine's working directory, which the engine requires because
  it resolves its data files relative to the current directory.

### Known issues
- **The process exit status is always 2**, successful or not: the AWK program is
  closed at line 859 of `engine/quadro14L.exe` and the trailing 24 lines of
  commented-out source are parsed by the shell instead. Cosmetic — judge success
  by whether a `.pdb` was produced.
- **Engine diagnostics are in Polish.** `docs/INPUT-FORMAT.md` carries a
  translated error table.
- `iteration_steps` checkpoints share a single build-up phase and differ only in
  the length of the final minimisation tail, so they explore less than their
  number suggests. Vary `iteration` across separate runs instead.
