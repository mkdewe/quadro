quadro — G-quadruplex 3D structure generator

USAGE
    docker run --rm -v "\$PWD:/work" quadro14m:latest [OPTIONS] INPUT.inp [INPUT2.inp ...]

    Paths are relative to /work, i.e. to the directory you mounted.

    Each input is built twice by default: as written, and mirrored — the same
    residues in the opposite-handed stack. That yields NAME.pdb and NAME_alt.pdb;
    keep whichever has the lower Etotal.

OPTIONS
    --no-mirror         Build only the input as written, skipping the mirror
                        pass. Halves the run time and gives up the comparison.
    --outdir DIR        Write results to DIR (relative to /work). Default: /work.
    --shell             Drop into an interactive shell inside the container.
    --version           Print the engine version and exit.
    -h, --help          Show this message.

OUTPUT
    For an input whose 'name' field is FOO, the engine writes FOO.pdb and
    FOO_energy.txt, plus FOO_alt.pdb and FOO_alt_energy.txt from the mirror
    pass. All are copied to the output directory, together with a .runlog
    holding the full engine output.

EXAMPLE
    docker run --rm -v "\$PWD:/work" quadro14m:latest examples/pz74.inp
